```

| Argument | Description | Mandatory |
|----|----|----|
| -p PAT, --pat PAT |Your GitHub Personal Access Token | Yes |
| -n, --npm | Attempt to run common npm commands (build, lint, pack) after applying fixes | No |
| -t TEAM, --team TEAM | Audit all repos belonging to this team | No |
| -o ORGANIZATION, --organization ORGANIZATION | Audit all repos belonging to this organization | No |
| -h | List commands | No |

If no team or organization name is provided, the tool will audit all the user's repos. 

GitHub does not allow the creation of PRs outside of organizations via the API, so you will need to raise a PR. The patched project can be found at repos/<REPO-NAME> after the tool runs. A suggested PR title and body will be outputed to the console for each repo.
